# Project Blueprint: Freebies Hub

## Overview

This project creates a clean, fast, and responsive web application for aggregating daily freebies for social casino and casual games. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly experience, achieve AdSense approval through high-quality, original content, and ensure compliance with modern web standards and privacy regulations.

## Monetization & AdSense Readiness Plan

To achieve AdSense approval and build a sustainable project, we will focus on three core areas:

### Phase 1: CMP (Consent Management Platform) & Compliance
*   **Goal:** Implement a Consent Management Platform to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations. This builds trust with users and is a critical requirement for monetization.
*   **Action:** Integrate a third-party CMP service (e.g., Osano, CookieYes) and create a comprehensive Privacy Policy page.

### Phase 2: Essential Page Creation
*   **Goal:** Establish the website's credibility and structure by creating essential informational pages.
*   **Pages:**
    *   **/about.html:** Introduce the mission and purpose of the site.
    *   **/privacy.html:** Detail the data handling and cookie policies.
    *   **/contact.html:** Provide a way for users to get in touch.

### Phase 3: Content Enrichment
*   **Goal:** Move beyond simple link aggregation to provide unique, valuable, and original content that AdSense reviewers and users will appreciate.
*   **Content Types:**
    *   **Expanded Post Details:** Each game's page will include unique content like game reviews, tips, and strategy guides.
    *   **Editorial Blog Posts:** Publish articles like "Top 5 Social Casino Games of the Year" or "How to Maximize Your Daily Freebies."

## Current Plan: Foundational Pages Setup

This sprint focuses on establishing the structural foundation required for Phase 1 and 2.

1.  **Update Blueprint:** The `blueprint.md` file has been updated with the new AdSense readiness goals.
2.  **Create Placeholder Pages:** Create the basic HTML structure for `about.html`, `privacy.html`, and `contact.html`.
3.  **Update Navigation:** Add links to the new pages in the main header and footer navigation in `index.html`.
