# Blueprint: Website Deployment

## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose:** This document outlines the plan to deploy the "Freebies Hub" website to a live hosting environment.

**Hosting Provider:** We will use Firebase Hosting for its speed, security, and reliability.

## 2. Deployment Plan

### Action Plan

1.  **Initialize Firebase Hosting:**
    *   Create a `firebase.json` file to configure the project for Firebase Hosting. This file will specify the public directory (`.` in this case, as the project is framework-less) and other hosting settings.

2.  **Deploy the Website:**
    *   Use the available tools to deploy the entire project directory to Firebase Hosting. This will make the website publicly accessible.

This plan will be executed to get the website live. I will then provide the user with the live URL.
